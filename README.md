This app uses [Vite](https://vite.dev) for the frontend [Convex](https://convex.dev) for the backend.

## Run the app locally

2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start Convex with `npx convex dev`. This will install the Convex backend locally.
4. In another terminal, run the Vite dev server with `npm run dev`
